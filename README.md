# About this Guide

This guide provides detailed instructions for exporting PyTorch machine learning models to the ONNX format. It aims to simplify the process of converting models to ONNX for interoperability and deployment across different platforms and frameworks.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.6+
- pip (Python package installer)
- Pytorch
- Basic understanding of machine learning models and frameworks
- ONNX and latest onnxruntime
- [Netron.app](https://netron.app/) for visualizing and analyzing ONNX models



## Installation

To get started, you'll need to install the necessary libraries. You can install the required libraries by using:

```terminal
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Exporting Models (Pytorch)

- AlexNet
- ResNet18
- ResNet34
- ResNet50
- ResNet101
- ResNet152
- ShuffleNet

## Examples
Find practical examples in the [Examples](Examples) directory.
